1. What is the Social Service Fellowship?
The Social Service Fellowship is an award that aims to recognise outstanding professionals in the social service sector. As experts in their respective professions, Social Service Fellows bring with them a wealth of knowledge, and serve as role models to guide and inspire younger professionals, and encourage more to join the social service sector.

2. Which social service professions qualify for the fellowship?
The fellowship is open to individuals who are social workers, therapists, Early Intervention Programme for Infants and Children (EIPIC) teachers, psychologists, counsellors, general management representatives and other professionals in the social service sector

Other criteria include:

At least 10 years of current and relevant work experience in the social service or associated sectors (e.g. healthcare)
Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents
3. How can I be considered for the Social Service Fellowship?
You will be assessed on the following aspects by the Social Service Fellowship Selection Panel:

Level of professional expertise
Impact of past, existing and future contributions to the social service sector
Demonstration of leadership competencies
4. Do corporate professionals in the social service sector qualify for the Social Service Fellowship?
Yes, professionals in the sector who work in corporate functions such as HR, Finance and Corporate Communications, can be eligible for the fellowship.

5. How will Social Service Fellows be recognised?
In recognition of their professional expertise and contributions to the sector, Social Service Fellows will be awarded a certificate, a letter of appointment, and a Service Recognition Award of $12,000 per annum (upon fulfilment of 80 hours of sector wide contribution per year) if they meet the Terms & Conditions of the fellowship.

6. Do I need to submit an application form if I had been nominated?
Yes. This is because other information not requested via the nomination form is still required for a fair assessment to be made during the selection process. The Social Service Fellowship Secretariat will approach you for the application form.

7. What is the selection process?
All applications will be rigorously reviewed by the Social Service Fellowship Selection Panel comprising sector leaders and representatives from the Ministry of Social and Family Development and NCSS management.

Interviews may be conducted when necessary. The decision of the selection panel is final.

8. What will be considered as appropriate contributions?
Fellows are able to contribute in a variety of ways including, but not limited to, mentoring, teaching, conducting or organising conferences and seminars, participating in advisory panels and committees or engaging in sector-level projects, as long as it is outside their scope of paid employment. For clarifications, please contact the NCSS scheme administrator.

9. In what ways will MSF/NCSS be supporting Fellows in contributing to the sector?
MSF and NCSS will be working closer with Fellows and Divisions to better curate possible projects appropriate and suitable for Fellows. To facilitate this, NCSS will need Fellows to provide us with a brief profile write-up (of around 100 words) and pointers on the areas which Fellows are keen to contribute towards, which will be shared with MSF and NCSS divisions. In addition, NCSS will organise regular engagement and networking between MSF, NCSS and Fellows.

10. I am unable to commit for the entire tenure of the Fellowship. Should I still submit an application?
Under the revised scheme, Fellows need to contribute 80 hours of sector development efforts to receive the annual award. Additionally, the annual hours of contributions will be taken into consideration during assessment for the next term of reappointment.

11. What do I need to submit as proof of contribution?
We will require supporting documents to be submitted along with the records of contributions (nature of activity, number of hours committed, verified/endorsed by authorised agency representatives/project owners), which the NCSS scheme administrators will seek every half-yearly from each Fellowâ€™s the date of appointment.

These supporting documents can be in the form of Letters of Appointment to panels and committees, email confirmation of your involvements in sectoral contributions from the organising committees, electronic direct mailers indicating your involvement as a speaker, etc.
